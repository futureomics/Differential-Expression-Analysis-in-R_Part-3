ðŸ§¬*Differential Gene Expression Analysis using R*ðŸ§¬

This repository contains R code and documentation for performing differential gene expression analysis using RNA-seq data.

*Contents:*

1. *Data*: Example RNA-seq count data in CSV format
2. *Code*: R scripts for differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 and edgeR
3. *Results*: Example output files containing differentially expressed genes

*Analysis Workflow:*

1. *Data Import*: Load RNA-seq count data into R
2. *Data Preprocessing*: Filter and normalize count data
3. *Differential Expression Analysis*: Use DESeq2 and edgeR to identify differentially expressed genes
4. *Results Visualization*: Visualize results using heatmaps, volcano plots, and gene ontology enrichment analysis

*Required R Packages:*

1. *DESeq2*: For differential gene expression analysis
2. *edgeR*: For differential gene expression analysis
3. *ggplot2*: For data visualization
4. *clusterProfiler*: For gene ontology enrichment analysis


*Example Output:*

The `Results` folder contains example output files, including:

1. *Differentially expressed genes*: CSV file containing gene IDs, fold changes, and p-values
2. *Heatmap*: PDF file containing a heatmap of differentially expressed genes
3. *Volcano plot*: PDF file containing a volcano plot of differentially expressed genes
